# Basic Syntax Tree Builder
This project is a simple syntax tree builder for English sentences, executed in Python. It uses a small lexicon and a hand-written grammar inspired by X-bar theory to parse basic sentence structures and display their syntax trees.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate basic syntatic trees to beginners, showing how syntax trees are built with X-bar theory.

# Features
- Right side supported recursion
- Simple English grammar (NP, VP, AdvP, AdjP, Det)
- Text-based syntax tree rendering
- X-bar theory embedded to the grammar

# How to Run
From the project root directory:
python main.py

# Motivation
This project was created as a learning exercise to combine Python programming with  basic linguistic theory, particularly syntax and phrase structure.
